# Syntaxic and formatting rules

To contribute to this project, you have to uphold and respect some rules, just to make everyone understand each other. Elseway, pain will be here.\

## Naming rules

Your variables, classes, interface and all this stuff shall be named in `camelCase`, for more developping confort and conforming to Java programming standards.

Needless to say, all the names shall be cristal clear for everyone to understand and be able to maintain this project at will or add new features to it without breaking the whole thing.

There are a few exceptions to this rule, and they are the interface and abstract classes naming conventions. Here is the list of exceptions :

- `Iinterface` must have the `I` preceding their true name.
- `Aabstractclasses` must have this `A` preceding their true name.
- `CONSTANTS_VALUES` shall be written in caps `snake_case`.
