# Syntaxic and formatting rules

To contribute to this project, you have to uphold and respect some rules, just to make everyone understand each other. Elseway, pain will be here.\

## Naming rules

Your variables, classes, interface and all this stuff shall be named in `camelCase`, for more developping confort and conforming to Java programming standards.

Needless to say, all the names shall be cristal clear for everyone to understand and be able to maintain this project at will or add new features to it without breaking the whole thing.

There are a few exceptions to this rule, and they are the interface and abstract classes naming conventions. Here is the list of exceptions :

- `Iinterface` must have the `I` preceding their true name.
- `Aabstractclasses` must have this `A` preceding their true name.
- `CONSTANTS_VALUES` shall be written in caps `snake_case`.

## Documentation

What is a code without documentation ? Nothing useful. You want to make yourself useful in this library ? Then you must comment and document your code, so everyone can comprehend it, not just you.

The documentation shall be clear and useful, so don't write anything like this :

```java
/**
 * This is an interface for trucs.
 * @author thing
 */
interface ITruc {}
```

It doesn't serve any purpose and is redundant with the name of the interface, polluting the code. If you write documentation, please make it relevant and useful to the others, by explaining what you *meant*, not what you wrote.

Please also don't write troll names or documentation, this is enough work just coding, documenting and debugging, no need to add trolls.
