# LibCorbac

This project is two-sided : it aims first to create an open-source library for roleplay bots, and fuel Corbac to be a proof of concept of this library.

## Features

This library should be able to :

| | Handle character creation and manipulation \
| | Handle webhooks to make characters "talk" \
| | Handle a multi-characters economy, but at the cost of liberty \
| | Handle dice rolling, the heart of any tabletop RPG \

## How to install

After cloning this repository, all you have to do is to run `mvn insall` et `mvn package`, to be sure to get the jar of this library.
